# Specification Quality Checklist: JSON Editor Scroll Behavior Demo

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding
to planning  
**Created**: February 24, 2026  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders (note: stakeholders are developers
      in this case)
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation completed**: All checklist items pass.

**Context Note**: This feature is a developer-focused testing tool, so the
"stakeholder" is a technical person (developer). The language appropriately
balances technical precision with clarity.

**Assumptions Added**: Documented key assumptions about existing JSON editor
component, access permissions, and the motivation for this testing feature.

**Ready for**: `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
